description:
A 1 or 2 player battleship game.  The one player version has 3 difficulty levels.  The easy level is completely random guesses by the computer.  At the medium level, the computer takes into account the probability a space will contain a ship.  At the hard level, open spaces with a adjacent hits are weighted at a higher probability if more than the immediate adjacent spaces are hits.  This gives the computer a better chance of firing in a line once multiple adjacent hits are made.

Known issues:  The hard level algorithm is not perfected.  The computer will occasionally make an incorrect pick.  This could be improved to make the computer nearly impossible if not impossible to beat.

approach:  The approach was to build out a basic game board and get the styling working.  I then made the 2 player version and added functionality from there.
